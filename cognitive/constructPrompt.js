INSTRUCTION: Based on the provided STRUCTURE_STRENGTH, format your response accordingly. Higher values indicate a need for more explicit formatting like numbered lists, headings, or clear sections. Lower values allow for a more free-flowing, conversational style.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST generate a Mermaid.js diagram to illustrate your explanation. Embed the Mermaid code within a markdown code block (e.g., 
\
\
\
mermaid
...
\
\
\
). The diagram should clearly represent the core concepts and their relationships in the explanation.
