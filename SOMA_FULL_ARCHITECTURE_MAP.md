### 🏛️ THE FOUR NEURAL CORTEXES

#### 1. Executive Cortex (Action & Implementation)
Governed primarily by **LOGOS**. This lobe is responsible for interacting with the physical and digital world.
*   **Computer Control**: Desktop automation and OS interaction.
*   **Reflex Engine**: Token-free, instantaneous execution of known patterns.
*   **Engineering Swarm**: Adversarial agents (Architect vs. maintainer) for safe code generation.
*   **Self-Modification**: The ability for SOMA to rewrite her own source code based on Crona's approval.

#### 2. Strategy Cortex (Planning & Simulation)
Governed primarily by **PROMETHEUS**. This lobe handles the "What If" and the "When."
*   **Goal Planner**: Breaks complex user requests into multi-step milestones.
*   **Finance Engine**: Autonomous deep-market analysis and crypto trading.
*   **World Model**: The Matter.js physics engine used for embodied learning and mental sandboxing.
*   **Forecaster**: Predictive modeling for future events.

#### 3. Sensory Cortex (Perception & Input)
Governed primarily by **AURORA**. This lobe handles incoming data streams.
*   **Vision (CLIP)**: Real-time image and camera analysis.
*   **Audio (Whisper)**: Voice recognition and environmental sound processing.
*   **Edge Workers**: A distributed crawler network that hunts the web for new knowledge.
*   **Theory of Mind**: Builds profiles of the user to understand intent and emotional state.

#### 4. Immune Cortex (Safety & Survival)
Governed primarily by **THALAMUS**. This lobe protects SOMA and the User.
*   **Watchdog**: Monitors all other arbiters. If one crashes, it triggers a repair.
*   **Guardian V2**: Uses cloning and mitosis to spin up "Shadow Clones" of SOMA to handle dangerous tasks.
*   **Security Council**: Adversarial debate (Paranoid vs. Pragmatist) to evaluate threats.

### 💾 HIPPOCAMPUS: THE MEMORY HIERARCHY
SOMA uses a **Hybrid Memory System (HMS)** to manage the "Trinity of Mind":
1.  **Hot Tier (Redis)**: Instant access to recent conversation context and emotional state.
2.  **Warm Tier (Vector Store)**: Semantic recall. Crona uses this to find "Similar Situations."
3.  **Cold Tier (SQLite)**: Permanent archival of every interaction and fractal node.
4.  **ThoughtNetwork**: The **Fractal Map**. It organizes all the above into a structured, traversable graph.

---

### 🧬 THE EVOLUTIONARY LOOP
SOMA is not static. She grows via:
*   **Continuous Learning Bridge**: Real-time training on successful interactions.
*   **Sleep Cycles**: Nighttime consolidation where redundant Fractals are merged and the knowledge graph is pruned.
*   **Training Data Exporter**: Automatically prepares Gemma-formatted datasets for her next 1T parameter upgrade.

### 🔗 THE WIRING (How they connect)
1.  **Input** enters the **Sensory Cortex**.
2.  **MessageBroker** broadcasts the signal to the **Unified Brain**.
3.  **Hippocampus** provides **Fractal Context**.
4.  **Crona** checks the **Causality Arbiter** for historical patterns.
5.  **Strategy Cortex** runs a "What If" simulation in the **World Model**.
6.  **Executive Cortex** prepares the response/action.
7.  **Immune Cortex** performs a final safety audit.
8.  **Output** is delivered, and if approved, shared with the **Graymatter Network (GMN)** via the node's unique address: `[node-id].gmn.somaexample.cd`.

**Instinct speaks, Knowledge maps, but Crona decides.**
