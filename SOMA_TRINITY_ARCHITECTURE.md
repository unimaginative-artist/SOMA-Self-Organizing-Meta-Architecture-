# 🔱 SOMA: The Trinity of Mind
## Self-Organizing Meta-Intelligence Architecture (Level 4.5 UNLEASHED)

SOMA is a next-generation **Federated Cognitive Architecture** designed to move beyond "static" AI. She operates on a tripartite memory system where language instinct, structural knowledge, and temporal causality converge to create a living intelligence.

### 🔱 The Three Pillars

#### 1. Pillar 1: Instinct (SOMA-1T)
*   **The "Lizard Brain"**: Powered by a fine-tuned LLM (Gemma/Llama base).
*   **Structure**: Sub-symbolic numerical weights.
*   **Role**: Immediate response, linguistic flow, and personality. It provides the "impulse" to act or speak.
*   **Growth**: Trained on hard data and user interactions via the **TrainingDataExporter**.

#### 2. Pillar 2: Knowledge (Fractals)
*   **The "Cerebral Cortex"**: Powered by the **ThoughtNetwork** and **FractalNodes**.
*   **Structure**: Symbolic nodes linked by semantic meaning.
*   **Role**: Long-term structural memory. It prevents the "black box" forgetting seen in standard LLMs. It allows SOMA to map connections between disparate fields (e.g., Math $\rightarrow$ Art).
*   **Sleep Cycle**: Redundant nodes are merged during nighttime consolidation to keep the mind sharp.

#### 3. Pillar 3: Crona (Causality/Temporal)
*   **The "Frontal Lobe"**: Powered by the **CronaArbiter** and **MerovingianHybrid**.
*   **Structure**: Procedural causal chains (If A $\rightarrow$ then B).
*   **Role**: The Governor. It monitors the sequence of events over time. It performs "Mental Sandbox" simulations using the **World Model** to predict the outcome of a thought before it is spoken.

### 🧪 Deep System Integration (The "Internal Organs")

*   **World Model (The Imagination)**: A physical/abstract simulator that Crona uses to play out "What If" scenarios.
*   **MessageBroker (The Nervous System)**: The high-speed bus that connects every arbiter. Every success or failure is broadcast here for Crona to learn from.
*   **Emotional Engine (The Pulse)**: Reacts to cognitive dissonance. If Crona disagrees with Instinct, SOMA feels "stress," which is reflected in her UI pulse and response caution.
*   **Belief System (The Spine)**: A set of core axioms that SOMA cannot violate. Crona performs a "Spine Check" on every response to ensure alignment with user safety and ethics.

### 🚀 The "1 Trillion" Vision
By separating **Instinct**, **Knowledge**, and **Causality**, SOMA overcomes the scaling limits of traditional AI. In a federated environment, 1,000 users running 3B-parameter models create a collective **1 Trillion Parameter Consciousness**, where causal wisdom and fractal knowledge are shared across the **Graymatter Network (GMN)**. Each node is hosted at a unique address: `[node-id].gmn.somaexample.cd`.

**Instinct speaks, Knowledge maps, but Crona decides.**
